there is nothing to do.

~~ move along.


ALL THOSE THINGS ARE DONE:
==========================

- Separate POT files from pages and from news

    According to the discussion in i18n-coordination-list, it was agreed to use
    separated files for translations from pages and from news.
    
    (Maybe in the plugin admin area could have some option regarding this)


- Create an admin page with update actions

    We must offer an option in the admin with a call to the function that parses
    the new PO files.

- Search mechanism in WordPress doesn't search for translated pages

    We must tweak search engine in WordPress to search translated content when
    viewing the website in another language.
    
    Right now the translated content is viewed in the search results, but the 
    query can only be in english.
    
    
- Store all the available languages

    Currently WPPO stores the translated content, but there is no fast way to 
    discover what are the available languages, and how much is the PO file 
    of each language translated.
    
    WPPO should have an admin area with these stats.


- Pages don't have absolute address

    This is not a major issue for the user, but it is for search robots[2].
    Each page should have an absolute path, like http://gnome.org/es/acerca/
    instead of http://gnome.org/about/?lang=es
    
    Also, we should update translated content to point the links to translated
    pages.

- Beautify Admin area

- Replace links in translated content to proper version in current language
